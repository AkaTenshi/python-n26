# N26 Python CLI/API
The idea is to have a convenient command line interface for [n26](https://n26.com/) to:
* Request account balance
* Make transactions
* Enable to only use API component (subclass) to integrate into own application

## CLI
### CLI setup
    pip3 install n26
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/femueller/python-n26/master/n26.yml.example ~/.config/n26.yml
    # configure username and password
    vim ~/.config/n26.yml

### CLI example
    n26 balance

## API

## Run locally
    git clone git@github.com:femueller/python-n26.git
    cd python-n26
    python -m n26 balance
