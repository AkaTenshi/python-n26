# N26 Python CLI/API
The idea is to have a convenient command line interface for [n26](https://n26.com/) to:
* Request account balance
* Make transactions
* Enable to only use API component (subclass) to integrate into own application

## Installation
    sudo pip install n26

## Examples
    n26 balance
